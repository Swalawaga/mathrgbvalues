So its really simple and poorly written but its kinda cool.
I made a thing after reading a thing. Pretty sure I didnt come up with any of this idea on my own also I just felt like making it.
Javascript canvas works like 0,0 is in the top left
I added math boxes which are html elements so you can access the x and y coordinates
you can change the red green and blue values of every pixel in the background using numbers
Im really tired and dont feel like explaining it.
